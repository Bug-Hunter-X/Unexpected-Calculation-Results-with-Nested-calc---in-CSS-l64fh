# Unexpected Calculation Results with Nested calc() in CSS

This repository demonstrates a common but often overlooked issue in CSS when using the `calc()` function with percentages in nested contexts. The `calc()` function, while powerful, can produce unexpected behavior if the calculation's reference point is not clearly understood.

The problem is illustrated in `nestedCalcBug.css`. The solution, illustrating how to resolve the issue, is in `nestedCalcSolution.css`.

## Issue:

When percentages are used within `calc()` in nested elements, the percentage is relative to the *immediate parent* element, not necessarily the viewport or a higher-level ancestor.  This can lead to miscalculations and layout problems that are difficult to track down.

## Solution:

Several strategies can mitigate this issue:

* **Avoid nested percentages in calc():** The most straightforward solution is often to refactor the CSS to avoid using nested percentages within `calc()`.  This enhances readability and reduces the chance of unexpected calculations.
* **Use absolute units (px, em, rem):** If possible, using absolute units like pixels, ems, or rems will remove the ambiguity of relative units within nested calculations.
* **Use JavaScript for more complex calculations:**  For complex layout requirements, it might be preferable to use JavaScript to calculate element dimensions instead of relying solely on CSS `calc()`.
